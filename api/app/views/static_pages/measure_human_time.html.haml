      In order to compare the various algorithms vs. bright human minds like yours, I need to collect some statistics

      Below are several boards. Why won't you try them? For your convenience, you can either solve the boards online
      or go with the old-fashioned way and print them (come as one-page PDFs). If you solve it by hand, please report
      your time at the form below.
